# SEA Stage 2 - Data Catalog Project

This project was created as part of the second stage of the Snap Engineering Academy. I made a web-based catalog that provides detailed information about different countries, including their travel requirements, local laws, and special entry/exit requirements for US citizens.

I would like to express my gratitude for the opportunity to participate in this stage of the [Snap Engineering Academy](https://www.snapacademies.com/apply-now)!
